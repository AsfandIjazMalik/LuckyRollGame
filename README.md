### Lucky Rolls Game 
### Description
Lucky Rolls is a Python-based multiplayer dice game that combines strategy and luck. Players compete to achieve the highest score by rolling a six-sided dice and strategically deciding when to save their score. Beware of rolling a 1â€”it wipes out your turn's progress! The game is simple, fun, and a great way to test your luck and risk-taking skills. <br>
### Features
â€¢	Multiplayer Support: Play with 2â€“4 players. <br>
â€¢	Interactive Gameplay: Decide whether to roll again or save your score after each turn. <br>
â€¢	Customizable Rules: Default winning score is 20 (can be easily adjusted). <br>
â€¢	Turn Skipping: Players can choose to skip their turn. <br>
â€¢	User-Friendly Menu: Options to play the game, read rules, or exit. <br>
### Game Rules
1.	Players take turns rolling a six-sided dice. <br>
2.	Roll as many times as you want in one turn to accumulate points. <br>
3.	Rolling a 1 ends your turn, and you lose all points earned that turn. <br>
4.	Rolling any other number adds it to your turn's score. <br>
5.	Save your score to add your turn's score to your total score. <br>
6.	The first player to reach or exceed the target score (default: 20) wins! <br>
### Concepts Used in Python
This game demonstrates the use of: <br>
â€¢	Functions: Modular design using reusable functions (roll_dice, playgame, display_game_rules). <br>
â€¢	Control Structures: if-else, while, and for loops. <br>
â€¢	User Input Handling: Validates and processes user inputs. <br>
â€¢	Random Module: Generates dice rolls (random.randint()).<br>
â€¢	Dictionaries: Stores and manages player scores dynamically. <br>
â€¢	String Manipulation: Formats and displays messages. <br>
â€¢	Game Logic: Implements turn-based decision-making and score tracking. <br>
